My project is a tarot reading program. It lets users choose between a daily card or a three-card spread. The daily card gives one message for the day. The three-card spread shows past, present, and future. The user first chooses a topic, like love, career, or health. Then, the program picks cards randomly and shows the meanings. It also gives a short summary at the end.  It is for fun and self-understanding.
